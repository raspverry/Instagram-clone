# Instagram-clone

This application is a simple mock up of Instagram, based on tutorial on Youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbixZZDjrdU&ab_channel=CleverProgrammer

Frontend UI was created by React Native with Formik and Yup, and Backend was created with Firebase V9.
The tutorial on Youtube was using Firebase V8 which has different format of code, therefore, I changed and adjusted it to V9.
